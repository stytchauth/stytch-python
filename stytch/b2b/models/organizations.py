      for SAML connections and not for OIDC. If the Member has a SAML Member registration with the given connection, this
      role assignment will appear in the list. However, for authorization check purposes (in
      [sessions authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-session) or in any endpoint that enforces RBAC with session
      headers), the Member will only be granted the Role if their session contains an authentication factor with the

      available for SAML connections and not for OIDC. If the Member has a SAML Member registration with the given

      argument to the [Update SAML connection](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/update-saml-connection) endpoint.

      a SCIM Member registration with the given connection, and belongs to a specific group within the IdP, this role assignment will appear in the list.

      SCIM group implicit role assignments can be updated by passing in the `scim_group_implicit_role_assignments`

    Fields:
      - provider_subject: The unique identifier for the User within a given OAuth provider. Also commonly called the `sub` or "Subject field" in OAuth protocols.
      - provider_tenant_id: The tenant ID returned by the OAuth provider. This is typically used to identify an organization or group within the provider's domain. For example, in HubSpot this is a Hub ID, in Slack this is the Workspace ID, and in GitHub this is an organization ID. This field will only be populated if exactly one tenant ID is returned from a successful OAuth authentication and developers should prefer `provider_tenant_ids` over this since it accounts for the possibility of an OAuth provider yielding multiple tenant IDs.
      - access_token: The `access_token` that you may use to access the User's data in the provider's API.
      - scopes: The OAuth scopes included for a given provider. See each provider's section above to see which scopes are included by default and how to add custom scopes.
      - bot_access_token: The `access_token` that you may use to access data as a bot application in Slack. Use in conjunction with `bot_scopes`.
      - bot_scopes: The scopes that the bot application has access to in Slack.
