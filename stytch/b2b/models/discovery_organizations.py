      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token is identical to the one that was originally passed in to the request.
          The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA flow and log in to the Organization.
          It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a different existing Organization,
          or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization.

      Note that Organizations will only appear here under any of the following conditions:
      1. The end user is already a Member of the Organization.
      2. The end user is invited to the Organization.
      3. The end user can join the Organization because:

          a) The Organization allows JIT provisioning.

          b) The Organizations' allowed domains list contains the Member's email domain.

          c) The Organization has at least one other Member with a verified email address with the same domain as the end user (to prevent phishing attacks).
