      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token is identical to the one that was originally passed in to the request. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.

      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.

      Note that Organizations will only appear here under any of the following conditions:
      1. The end user is already a Member of the Organization.
      2. The end user is invited to the Organization.
      3. The end user can join the Organization because:

          a) The Organization allows JIT provisioning.

          b) The Organizations' allowed domains list contains the Member's email domain.

          c) The Organization has at least one other Member with a verified email address with the same domain as the end user (to prevent phishing attacks).

The Organization ID will be null if the intermediate session token was generated by a email magic link discovery or OAuth discovery flow.
