    """Response type for `SSO.authenticate`.
    Fields:
      - member_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
      - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - reset_session: Indicates if all Sessions linked to the Member need to be reset. You should check this field if you aren't using
        Stytch's Session product. If you are using Stytch's Session product, we revoke the Memberâ€™s other Sessions for you.
      - organization: The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains an SSO factor associated with the Member.
          The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA flow and log in to the Organization.
          SSO factors are not transferable between Organizations, so the intermediate session token is not valid for use with discovery endpoints.
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - member_session: The [Session object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object).
      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.
