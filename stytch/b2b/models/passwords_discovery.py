class AuthenticateResponse(ResponseBase):
    """Response type for `Discovery.authenticate`.
    Fields:
      - email_address: The email address.
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains a password factor associated with the Member. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. Password factors are not transferable between Organizations, so the intermediate session token is not valid for use with discovery endpoints.
      - discovered_organizations: An array of `discovered_organization` objects tied to the `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt`. See the [Discovered Organization Object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/discovered-organization-object) for complete details.

      Note that Organizations will only appear here under any of the following conditions:
      1. The end user is already a Member of the Organization.
      2. The end user is invited to the Organization.
      3. The end user can join the Organization because:

          a) The Organization allows JIT provisioning.

          b) The Organizations' allowed domains list contains the Member's email domain.

          c) The Organization has at least one other Member with a verified email address with the same domain as the end user (to prevent phishing attacks).
