    Fields:
      - member_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
      - method_id: The email or device involved in the authentication.
      - reset_sessions: Indicates if all Sessions linked to the Member need to be reset. You should check this field if you aren't using
        Stytch's Session product. If you are using Stytch's Session product, we revoke the Memberâ€™s other Sessions for you.
      - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - member_session: The [Session object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object).

      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains an Email Magic Link factor associated with the Member's email address.
          The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA flow and log in to the Organization.
          It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a different existing Organization that allows login with Email Magic Links,
          or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization.
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.
