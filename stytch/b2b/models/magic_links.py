    Fields:
      - member_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
      - method_id: The email or device involved in the authentication.
      - reset_sessions: This field is deprecated.
      - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - organization: The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains an Email Magic Link factor associated with the Member's email address. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - member_session: The [Session object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object).
      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.
