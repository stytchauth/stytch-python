    Fields:
      - member_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - organization: The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains a password factor associated with the Member. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. Password factors are not transferable between Organizations, so the intermediate session token is not valid for use with discovery endpoints.
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - member_session: The [Session object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object).
      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.
