class AuthenticateResponse(ResponseBase):
    """Response type for `Discovery.authenticate`.
    Fields:
      - intermediate_session_token: The Intermediate Session Token. This token does not necessarily belong to a specific instance of a Member, but represents a bag of factors that may be converted to a member session.
        The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete an MFA flow;
        the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token;
        or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.
      - email_address: The email address.
      - discovered_organizations: An array of `discovered_organization` objects tied to the `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt`. See the [Discovered Organization Object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/discovered-organization-object) for complete details.

      Note that Organizations will only appear here under any of the following conditions:
      1. The end user is already a Member of the Organization.
      2. The end user is invited to the Organization.
      3. The end user can join the Organization because:

          a) The Organization allows JIT provisioning.

          b) The Organizations' allowed domains list contains the Member's email domain.

          c) The Organization has at least one other Member with a verified email address with the same domain as the end user (to prevent phishing attacks).
