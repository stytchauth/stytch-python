      - member_email_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a member's email
      - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - organization: The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains a password factor associated with the Member.
          The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA flow and log in to the Organization.
          Password factors are not transferable between Organizations, so the intermediate session token is not valid for use with discovery endpoints.
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - member_session: The [Session object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object).
      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.
