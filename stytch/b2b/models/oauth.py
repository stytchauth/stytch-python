The exact content of each ID Token varies from provider to provider. ID Tokens are returned from OAuth providers that conform to the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/foundation/) specification, which is based on OAuth.

class AuthenticateResponse(ResponseBase):
    """Response type for `OAuth.authenticate`.
    Fields:
      - member_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Member.
      - provider_subject: The unique identifier for the User within a given OAuth provider. Also commonly called the `sub` or "Subject field" in OAuth protocols.
      - provider_type: Denotes the OAuth identity provider that the user has authenticated with, e.g. Google, Microsoft, GitHub etc.
      - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
      - member: The [Member object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object)
      - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
      - organization: The [Organization object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object).
      - reset_sessions: This field is deprecated.
      - member_authenticated: Indicates whether the Member is fully authenticated. If false, the Member needs to complete an MFA step to log in to the Organization.
      - intermediate_session_token: The returned Intermediate Session Token contains an OAuth factor associated with the Member's email address. If this value is non-empty, the member must complete an MFA step to finish logging in to the Organization. The token can be used with the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms), [TOTP Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-totp), or [Recovery Codes Recover endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/recovery-codes-recover) to complete an MFA flow and log in to the Organization. It can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session) to join a specific Organization that allows the factors represented by the intermediate session token; or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to create a new Organization and Member.
      - member_session: The [Session object](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/session-object).
      - provider_values: The `provider_values` object lists relevant identifiers, values, and scopes for a given OAuth provider. For example this object will include a provider's `access_token` that you can use to access the provider's API for a given user.

      Note that these values will vary based on the OAuth provider in question, e.g. `id_token` is only returned by Microsoft. Google One Tap does not return access tokens or refresh tokens.
      - mfa_required: Information about the MFA requirements of the Organization and the Member's options for fulfilling MFA.
      - primary_required: Information about the primary authentication requirements of the Organization.
