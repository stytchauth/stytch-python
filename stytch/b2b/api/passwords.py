        The member's email will be marked as verified when you use this endpoint. If you are using **cross-organization passwords**, call this method separately for each `organization_id` associated with the given `email_address` to ensure the email is verified across all of their organizations.

        Fields:
          - email_address: The email address of the Member.
          - hash: The password hash. For a Scrypt or PBKDF2 hash, the hash needs to be a base64 encoded string.
          - hash_type: The password hash used. Currently `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, `argon_2i`, `argon2_id`, `md_5`, `sha_1`, and `pbkdf_2` are supported.
          - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value. You may also use the organization_slug here as a convenience.

          - scrypt_config: Required parameters if the scrypt is not provided in a **PHC encoded form**.
          - pbkdf_2_config: Required additional parameters for PBKDF2 hash keys. Note that we use the SHA-256 by default, please contact [support@stytch.com](mailto:support@stytch.com) if you use another hashing function.
          - name: The name of the Member. Each field in the name object is optional.

          - password: The password to authenticate, reset, or set for the first time. Any UTF8 character is allowed, e.g. spaces, emojis, non-English characers, etc.
          - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
          - session_duration_minutes: Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
          returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
          five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.

          This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).

          If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.

          If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
          to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
          - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
          - session_custom_claims: Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
          `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
          delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
          Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
          - locale: If the needs to complete an MFA step, and the Member has a phone number, this endpoint will pre-emptively send a one-time passcode (OTP) to the Member's phone number. The locale argument will be used to determine which language to use when sending the passcode.

        Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.

        Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.

          - intermediate_session_token: Adds this primary authentication factor to the intermediate session token. If the resulting set of factors satisfies the organization's primary authentication requirements and MFA requirements, the intermediate session token will be consumed and converted to a member session. If not, the same intermediate session token will be returned.
