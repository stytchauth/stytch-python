        """Reset the member’s password using their existing password.

        This endpoint adapts to your Project's password strength configuration.
        If you're using [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy), the default, your passwords are considered valid
        if the strength score is >= 3. If you're using [LUDS](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy), your passwords are
        considered valid if they meet the requirements that you've set with Stytch.
        You may update your password strength configuration in the [stytch dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/password-strength-config).

        If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
        The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the MFA step and acquire a full member session.
        The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will be ignored.

        If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will not be required to complete an MFA step.

        Fields:
          - email_address: The email address of the Member.
          - existing_password: The member's current password that they supplied.
          - new_password: The member's elected new password.
          - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value.
          - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
          - session_duration_minutes: Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
          returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
          five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.

          This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).

          If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.

          If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
          to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
          - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
          - session_custom_claims: Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
          `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
          delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
          Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
          - locale: If the Member needs to complete an MFA step, and the Member has a phone number, this endpoint will pre-emptively send a one-time passcode (OTP) to the Member's phone number. The locale argument will be used to determine which language to use when sending the passcode.

        Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.

        Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.

        Request support for additional languages [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSpAu_m2AmLXRT3F3kap-s_mcV6UTBitYn6CdyWP0-o7YjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link")!
