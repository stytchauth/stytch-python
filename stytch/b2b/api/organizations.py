Continue to make calls until the next_cursor in the response is null.

        - `limit`: The number of Organizations to return per page, the default is 100. A maximum of 1000 Organizations can be returned by a single request. If the total size of your result is greater than one page size, you must paginate the response. See the cursor field above.

        - `query`: The optional query object contains the operator, e.g. AND or OR, and the operands that will filter your Organizations. Only an operator is required, if you include no operands, no filtering will be applied.
