        Note that a successful password reset via an existing session will revoke all active sessions for the `member_id`, except for the one used during the reset flow.

        Fields:
          - organization_id: Globally unique UUID that identifies a specific Organization. The `organization_id` is critical to perform operations on an Organization, so be sure to preserve this value. You may also use the organization_slug here as a convenience.
          - password: The password to authenticate, reset, or set for the first time. Any UTF8 character is allowed, e.g. spaces, emojis, non-English characers, etc.
          - session_token: A secret token for a given Stytch Session.
          - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) for a given Stytch Session.
          - session_duration_minutes: Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
          returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
          five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.

          This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).

          If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.

          If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration. If you don't want
          to use the Stytch session product, you can ignore the session fields in the response.
          - session_custom_claims: Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in
          `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To
          delete a key, supply a null value. Custom claims made with reserved claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti`) will be ignored.
          Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
          - locale: Used to determine which language to use when sending the user this delivery method. Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.

        Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.
