    """Response type for `OTPs.authenticate`.
    Fields:
      - user_id: The unique ID for a User. When making API calls, you may use an `external_id` in place of the `user_id` if one is set for the User.
      - method_id: The `email_id` or `phone_id` involved in the given authentication.
      - session_token: The `session_token` associated with a User's existing Session.
      - session_jwt: The JSON Web Token (JWT) associated with a User's existing Session.
      - user: The `user` object affected by this API call.
      - reset_sessions: Indicates if all other of the User's Sessions need to be reset. You should check this field if you aren't using Stytch's Session product. If you are using Stytch's Session product, we revoke the User's other sessions for you.
      - session: If you initiate a Session, by including `session_duration_minutes` in your authenticate call, you'll receive a full Session object in the response.
      - user_device: If a valid `telemetry_id` was passed in the request and the Fingerprint Lookup API returned results, this field will contain information about the user's device attributes.
