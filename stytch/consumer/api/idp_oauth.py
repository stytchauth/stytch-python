        This endpoint validates various fields (`scope`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `prompt`, etc...) are correct and returns
        relevant information for rendering an OAuth Consent Screen.

        This endpoint returns:
        - A public representation of the Connected App requesting authorization
        - Whether _explicit_ user consent must be granted before proceeding with the authorization
        - A list of scopes the user has the ability to grant the Connected App

        Use this response to prompt the user for consent (if necessary) before calling the [Submit OAuth Authorization](https://stytch.com/docs/api/connected-apps-oauth-authorize) endpoint.

        Exactly one of the following must be provided to identify the user granting authorization:
        - `user_id`
        - `session_token`
        - `session_jwt`

        If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed, the OAuth Authorization will be linked to the user's session for tracking purposes.
        One of these fields must be used if the Connected App intends to complete the [Exchange Access Token](https://stytch.com/docs/api/connected-app-access-token-exchange) flow.

        Fields:
          - client_id: The ID of the Connected App client.
          - redirect_uri: The callback URI used to redirect the user after authentication. This is the same URI provided at the start of the OAuth flow.  This field is required when using the `authorization_code` grant.
          - response_type: The OAuth 2.0 response type. For authorization code flows this value is `code`.
          - scopes: An array of scopes requested by the client.
          - user_id: The unique ID of a specific User. You may use an `external_id` here if one is set for the user.
          - session_token: The `session_token` associated with a User's existing Session.
          - session_jwt: The `session_jwt` associated with a User's existing Session.
          - prompt: Space separated list that specifies how the Authorization Server should prompt the user for reauthentication and consent. Only `consent` is supported today.
