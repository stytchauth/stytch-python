The endpoint will error if the session does not have a password, email magic link, or email OTP authentication factor that has been issued within the last 5 minutes. This endpoint requires either a `session_jwt` or `session_token` be included in the request.

        Note that a successful password reset via an existing session will revoke all active sessions for the `user_id`, except for the one used during the reset flow.

        Fields:
          - password: The password for the user. Any UTF8 character is allowed, e.g. spaces, emojis, non-English characers, etc.
          - session_token: The `session_token` associated with a User's existing Session.
          - session_jwt: The `session_jwt` associated with a User's existing Session.
          - session_duration_minutes: Set the session lifetime to be this many minutes from now. This will start a new session if one doesn't already exist,
          returning both an opaque `session_token` and `session_jwt` for this session. Remember that the `session_jwt` will have a fixed lifetime of
          five minutes regardless of the underlying session duration, and will need to be refreshed over time.

          This value must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 527040 minutes (366 days).

          If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is provided then a successful authentication will continue to extend the session this many minutes.

          If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will not be created.
          - session_custom_claims: Add a custom claims map to the Session being authenticated. Claims are only created if a Session is initialized by providing a value in `session_duration_minutes`. Claims will be included on the Session object and in the JWT. To update a key in an existing Session, supply a new value. To delete a key, supply a null value.

          Custom claims made with reserved claims ("iss", "sub", "aud", "exp", "nbf", "iat", "jti") will be ignored. Total custom claims size cannot exceed four kilobytes.
