          - email: The email address of the end user.
          - hash: The password hash. For a Scrypt or PBKDF2 hash, the hash needs to be a base64 encoded string.
          - hash_type: The password hash used. Currently `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, `argon_2i`, `argon_2id`, `md_5`, `sha_1`, and `pbkdf_2` are supported.
          - md_5_config: Optional parameters for MD-5 hash types.
          - argon_2_config: Required parameters if the argon2 hex form, as opposed to the encoded form, is supplied.
          - sha_1_config: Optional parameters for SHA-1 hash types.
          - scrypt_config: Required parameters if the scrypt is not provided in a [PHC encoded form](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md#phc-string-format).
          - pbkdf_2_config: Required additional parameters for PBKDF2 hash keys.
          - trusted_metadata: The `trusted_metadata` field contains an arbitrary JSON object of application-specific data. See the [Metadata](https://stytch.com/docs/api/metadata) reference for complete field behavior details.
          - untrusted_metadata: The `untrusted_metadata` field contains an arbitrary JSON object of application-specific data. Untrusted metadata can be edited by end users directly via the SDK, and **cannot be used to store critical information.** See the [Metadata](https://stytch.com/docs/api/metadata) reference for complete field behavior details.
          - set_email_verified: Whether to set the user's email as verified. This is a dangerous field. Incorrect use may lead to users getting erroneously
                        deduplicated into one user object. This flag should only be set if you can attest that the user owns the email address in question.
                        Access to this field is restricted. To enable it, please send us a note at support@stytch.com.
          - name: The name of the user. Each field in the name object is optional.
          - phone_number: The phone number of the user. The phone number should be in E.164 format (i.e. +1XXXXXXXXXX).
          - set_phone_number_verified: Whether to set the user's phone number as verified. This is a dangerous field. This flag should only be set if you can attest that
           the user owns the phone number in question. Access to this field is restricted. To enable it, please send us a note at support@stytch.com.
