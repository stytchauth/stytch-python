        Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.

        ### Cost to send SMS OTP
        Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).

        ### Add a phone number to an existing user

        This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send one-time passcode by SMS request will add the new, unverified phone number to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates within 5 minutes, the new phone number will be marked as verified and remain permanently on the existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object, and any subsequent login requests using that phone number will create a new User.

        ### Next steps

        Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.

        Fields:
          - phone_number: The phone number to use for one-time passcodes. The phone number should be in E.164 format (i.e. +1XXXXXXXXXX). You may use +10000000000 to test this endpoint, see [Testing](https://stytch.com/docs/home#resources_testing) for more detail.
          - expiration_minutes: Set the expiration for the one-time passcode, in minutes. The minimum expiration is 1 minute and the maximum is 10 minutes. The default expiration is 2 minutes.
          - attributes: Provided attributes help with fraud detection.
          - locale: Used to determine which language to use when sending the user this delivery method. Parameter is a [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), e.g. `"en"`.

        Currently supported languages are English (`"en"`), Spanish (`"es"`), and Brazilian Portuguese (`"pt-br"`); if no value is provided, the copy defaults to English.

        Request support for additional languages [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSpAu_m2AmLXRT3F3kap-s_mcV6UTBitYn6CdyWP0-o7YjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link")!
